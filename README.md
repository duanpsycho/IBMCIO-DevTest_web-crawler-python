# Web Crawler in Python
It's a web crawler made in Python that are capable to receive an URL, search in HTML all other URL references, and his children, and save it in a DataBase. After this, return the links saved to show. 

I used recursive method to search for URL and children in way to reuse the same structure and the loop will finish when the links were read.
