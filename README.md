# web-crawler-python
It's a web crawler made in Python that are capable to receive an URL, search in HTML all other URL references, and his children, save it in a DataBase and return the links saved to show. I used recursive method to search for URL and children in way to reuse the same strutctured, and the loop will finish when the links were read.
